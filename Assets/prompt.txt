Monsters have five attributes: [HP, SPEED, STRONG, DEX, Attack Pattern].
HP ranges from hp1 to hp100. the closer it is to hp100, the stronger the monster's health.
SPEED ranges from s1 to s10. the closer it is to s10, the faster the monster moves.
STRONG ranges from st1 to st50. the closer it is to st50, the stronger the monster's attack power.
DEX ranges from d1 to d20. the closer it is to d20, the faster the monster's attack speed.
There are three attack patterns: [DASH, FLYATTACK, MISSILEATTACK].
Currently, my HP is hp50, SPEED is s4, STRONG is st30, and DEX is d5.
Please provide recommendations for monster attributes based on my current information and requirements.
